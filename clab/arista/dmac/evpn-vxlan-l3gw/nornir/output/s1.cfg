! SPINE-ONLY-CONFIG
! Spines act as a pure Layer 3 device. They don't need SPT
spanning-tree mode none

! UNDERLAY
! The aim here is to create BGP Peerings via the physical interfaces between the Leaves and the Spines.
! After the peering has been created, we will advertise the Lo0 via eBGP to be used for peering in the OVerlay (EVPN - Control Plane) and L1 to be used as the VTEP Source IP (VXLAN - Data Plane)

! Define the Loopbacks we want to advertise
ip prefix-list PL-LOOPBACKS seq 10 permit 10.255.0.1/32

! Create a Route Map
route-map RM-UNDERLAY-ADVERTISE permit 10
